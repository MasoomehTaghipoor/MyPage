        <h1>Robustness, from a Woolly Concept to Operational Measures</h1>

        <h2>Presentation of the Module</h2>
        <p>Farm animals are constantly facing perturbations due to changing environmental and farm conditions, which influence their performance and health. Characterization of animal response when faced with these perturbations is of main concern to ensure a sustainable production.</p>
        <p>A better understanding of the adaptation mechanisms used by the animal to cope with these perturbations (through resistance and resilience) is a prerequisite to propose adequate farm management strategies and for the development of precision livestock farming systems.</p>
        <p>Several experimental studies were conducted to investigate the influence of environment on the performance of farm animals. To get the most out of experimental data, the use of mathematical models is necessary to consider the systemic aspect of animal response. Accordingly, in this course, we will discuss different modelling tools to quantify and characterize the animalâ€™s adaptive response and the robustness trait.</p>

        <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide the elements for understanding the concept of animal robustness as a complex, multi-level and dynamic concept. We will also discuss its relevance in management strategies.</li>
            <li>To discuss the multi-component aspect of robustness, and the fact that the trade-off between different functions (e.g., survival, production, and reproduction) is necessary to ensure the robustness of an animal.</li>
            <li>To provide mathematical and statistical tools to characterize and quantify this important trait.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This course helps participants expand their international network.</p>

        <h2>Pedagogic Strategy</h2>
        <p>The school includes plenary lectures, practical works, and seminars. We put a focus on time dedicated to practical works and discussions (at least 50% of school time).</p>

        <h2>Prerequisites / Target Audience</h2>
        <p>The school is addressed to French and International PhD students, all biologists, and animal scientists (Post-docs, educational staff, and professionals) interested in the robustness concept and the modelling tools to characterize it.</p>
        <p>Basic knowledge of biology, particularly the concept of robustness, is appreciated. However, you do not need to be a modeller to participate in this school.</p>

        <h2>Program</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Introduction to robustness, animal adaptation, and resilience faced with different types of perturbation (e.g., sanitary and nutritional challenges, heat stress, and other environmental perturbations).</li>
            <li>State of the art of current problems in breeding programs for different species of farm animals and their influence on production performance (e.g., acidosis in ruminants, diarrhea at weaning for monogastrics, non-controlled environmental perturbations, etc.).</li>
            <li>New phenotyping technologies: from high-throughput omic data at different levels to high-frequency data of precision livestock systems.</li>
            <li>Statistical and mathematical methods for modelling and analyzing phenotyping data to extract biologically meaningful information, especially to quantify the robustness trait. This part of the course explains how the type of data drives the choice of the appropriate analysis strategy.</li>
            <li>Discussion on how farmers and breeding companies can apply robustness indicators.</li>
        </ol>
